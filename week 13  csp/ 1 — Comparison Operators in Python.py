# Objective:
# Students will learn how to compare values using Python’s comparison operators and interpret Boolean results.

# Topics Covered:
# ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

# Key Notes:

# Comparison operators compare two values and return either True or False.

# Remember: = is assignment, while == is comparison.

a = 3
b = 4
print(a) #output 3
print(b) # output4
print(a == b) #output False

print(a == b)   # checks for equality#False
print(a != b)   # checks if its not equal # True
print(a > b)    # checks for greater than # False
print(a < b)    # checks for less than # True
print(a >= b)   # checks for greater than or equal to # False
print(a <= b)   # checks for lesss than or equal to # True


#predict the output of the following comparisons:
10 > 5 #output True
7 == 2 * 3 + 1 # output true
8 != 8 # output False
4 <= 2 + 2 #output True

# Write 3 examples that result in True and 3 that result in False.
7 > 5 #output True
3 < 10 #output True
5 == 3 + 2 #output True

6 > 11 # output False
8 < 2 # output False
4 + 10 <= 2 # output False

# Create a simple grade-checking condition:

# practice problem :
# where a student must check if their score is greater than or equal to 60 to pass a test.# The password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one digit.password = "mypassword1"

# asking student score
score = int(input("What is your score?"))
# make this program for all grading spectrums
# if the score is between 90 -100 . . you got an A
# if the score is between 80 - 89 -- you got a B
# if the score is between 70 - 79 -- you got a C
# if the score is between 61 - 69... you got a D
# else you failed


if score >= 60:
    print("you passed the test")
else:
    print("You didn't pass")
if score >=90 <=100:
    print("You got an A")
if score >=80 <=89:
    print("You got a B")
# if the score is between 70 - 79 -- you got a C
elif score >=70 & score<=79:
     print("you got a C")
# if the score is between 61 - 69... you got a D
elif score >=60 & score <= 69:
    print("You got a D")
else:
    print("you failed, come for ACLAB")

# The password must be at least 8 characters long
#  and contain at least one digit.password = "mypassword1"
#ask for a password
password = input("What is your password? ")
if len(password) >=8 and any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
    print("Password is valid")
else:
    print("Password is invalid," \
          "It must be at least 8 charecters long and contain at least one digit. ")
